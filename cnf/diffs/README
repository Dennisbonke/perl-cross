Patchsets here are tagged with exact upstream version, but that's mostly
to catch misapplications early, and to ensure the patches themselves remain
readable. In most case a new version only needs minor offset tweaks.

Copy the closest available version and update the patches if necessary.

Note cperl comes with liblist.patch already integrated.
