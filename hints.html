<p>Hints are pre-defined values for config.sh variables, used when
testing for particular value is impossible or such test should be
avoided for whatever reasons.</p>

<p>Hints for perl-cross are stored under <tt>cnf/hints</tt>. They are
loaded automatically, depending on host, target and compiler settings,
in the following order:</p>
<div>
	[mode-]arch-machine-os-type<br>
	[mode-]arch-machine<br>
	[mode-]arch<br>
	[mode-]os-type<br>
	[mode-]os<br>
	default
</div>
<p>with <span>arch-machine-os-type</span> being standard target description
triplet (or quadruplet) like <tt>i686-pc-linux-gnu</tt>. <span>mode</span> can
be either <tt>host</tt> or <tt>target</tt>. All matching files are loaded,
and the most specific value is used.</p>

<p>Despite their looks, hints are not just regular shell scripts.
They are filtered with <tt>sed</tt> and generally should not contain
anything but</p>
<pre>
	variable="properly quoted value"
</pre>
<p>lines, which are internally converted to</p>
<pre>
	hint variable "properly quoted value"
</pre>
<p>and then executed.</p>


<h2>Difference between mainline perl hints and perl-cross hints</h2>

<p>Hint files supplied with the mainline perl (hints/ in the source tree)
and not used by perl-cross configure. This is mainly because mainline perl
hint files are expected to take care of preset variables and command line
options by themselves, in style with the rest of Configure, while perl-cross
configure handles such things in a different manner.
These two systems do not mix very well.</p>

<p>Another reason is that mainline hints are allowed to run tests and look
around in the host system, which is a good way to get into troubles during
cross builds.</p>

<p>Mainline hints use <span>(os).sh</span> naming scheme and must determine
other aspects of target configuration internally using conditionals.
In contrast, perl-cross uses much more elaborate (and less portable) naming
scheme with no logic within the hints.</p>

<p>perl-cross does not support callbacks and per-file cflags from the mainline
hints. Callbacks are not really necessary in non-interactive mode because all
user-set values are known from the very start, and cctype hints partially
solve the problem of compiler related settings.
Per-file cflags are not implemented yet.</p>
