<p>Perl ships with an extensive test suite, covering the interpreter itself
and most of the modules. To run a full test, use
<pre>
	(cd t &amp;&amp; ./perl harness)
</pre>
or just
<pre>
	make test
</pre>
This works just as well with perl-cross â€” assuming you do it on the target
from within a full perl build tree. Depending on the target, the latter part
may not be practical, and actually makes little sense when you think of it.</p>

<p>perl-cross provides an alternative way for on-target testing: testpack,
tarball with the tests (and little else) that can be transferred to the
target. It's must smaller than the perl tree, ~23MB instead of 150+MB,
and unlike <tt>make test</tt> it's set up to test the perl that's already
installed in its proper location.</p>

<p>To make the pack, run
<pre>
	make testpack
</pre>
then transfer TESTPACK.tar.gz to the target, unpack it there and do
<pre>
	(cd TESTPACK/t/ &amp;&amp; ./perl harness)
</pre>
Run
<pre>
	make clean-testpack
</pre>
in the source tree to remove TESTPACK/ if necessary after TESTPACK.tar.gz has been built.</p>

<p>At this point testpack does not include all the tests that <tt>make test</tt> does.
So if you need to make absolutely sure the perl passes every test, do transfer the whole
build tree and run <tt>make test</tt> instead. However, testpack should be more than enough
to catch bad cross-compiling issues.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>Just like the rest of the language, perl testsuite is one big hack with a lot of
counter-intuitive and counter-productive issues no-one bothers to fix. Following
the tradition, I merely document some of them here.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some of the tests scan perl source tree and/or check it against MANIFEST.
	If you did some equivalent of "make DESTDIR=`pwd`/out install" within the
	source tree, make sure to remove out/ before running tests.</li>
	<li>It may be tempting to run "perl harness" instead of
	"./perl harness". It will work, however the actual tests will still be run
	using ./perl, so if you do that make sure "perl" and "./perl" are the same.</li>
	<li>The tests (NOT the harness!) decide whether to run themselves by checking
	$Config{extensions}.</li>
	<li>Most tests do reset @INC and populate it with values like "../lib" etc.
	Testpack mitigates it somewhat, but it's still there.</li>
	<li>(harness only) $PERL5LIB value is ignored, however $PERL5LIB_TEST will be used.
	See t/TEST for reference.</li>
	<li>Test for some cpan/ modules do different things depending on $PERL_CORE value.
	Even in testpack, $PERL_CORE will be 1. Don't ask. Google for "dual-life perl module".</li>
	<li>To run a single test, use something like
	<pre>
		./perl harness ../cpan/Archive-Extract/t/01_Archive-Extract.t
	</pre>
	from the t/ directory. It is possible to run some of the tests without harness,
	but others will fail with bogus error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tests excluded from testpack</h3>

<p>Check TESTPACK.px, namely %exclude hash at the top.</p>

<p>Short summary: porting/, most of ExtUtils, CPAN meta-modules and some XS stuff is excluded,
the rest should work. Given the nature of the excluded tests, they will probably never work
well with cross-builds. Also, XS::APItest and anything that depends on it.</p>
